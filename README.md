### 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing world-wide energy consumption patterns using SQL to extract meaningful insights from a structured dataset. The objective is to understand how energy usage varies across countries, regions, and energy sources over time, and to support data-driven discussions around sustainability and energy demand.

### 🎯 Objectives

Analyze global energy consumption trends across multiple countries

Compare energy usage by energy source (fossil fuels, renewables, etc.)

Identify top energy-consuming countries and regions

Observe year-wise and region-wise consumption patterns

Practice real-world SQL querying for analytical problem-solving

### 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains global energy consumption data including:

Country / Region

Year

Energy source type

Total energy consumption values

Renewable vs non-renewable energy usage

(Dataset sourced for educational and analytical purposes)

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)

SQL concepts used:

SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY

Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)

Subqueries & CTEs

Joins

Date-based analysis

### 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Global energy consumption trend over the years

Top countries by total energy consumption

Renewable vs non-renewable energy comparison

Regional energy demand analysis

Average energy consumption per country

Year-on-year growth analysis

### 📊 Key Insights

Energy consumption has shown a steady increase over time, driven mainly by industrialized nations

Renewable energy usage is growing, but fossil fuels still dominate global consumption

Significant regional variation exists in energy demand and energy source dependency
